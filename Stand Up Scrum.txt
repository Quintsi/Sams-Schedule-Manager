Stand-Up / Scrum

December 1 (first day) -

Yesterday I didn't do anything; today is my first day so this part is left blank.

Today, I will begin on the skeleton of the JavaFX project -- building a grooming schedule.

What blockers do I have? Nothing as of yet.


December 2 -

Yesterday I finished setting up the environment to work on JavafX grooming schedule and made a skeleton for the navigation view

Today, I will finish the skeleton for the remainder of the views and begin making controllers for each view.

I had some difficulty setting up the environment yesterday, for example I had some difficulty the with build path. Today the environment works fine; it's been tested with no errors.


December 3 -

Yesterday I completed the skeleton for the app. I started making controllers for each view, but ran into an issue.

Today I will refactor some of the code I did yesterday to make it easier to work with. I will also create logic to switch between the views

I had difficulty with how I will organize the views so that the stage could display two different nodes at the same time. I used Group two display two at once but there is an easier way to go about it
and will make the code easier to work on.
